<p>I am currently a Lecturer in Environment and Public Health at the <a href="ecehh.org">European Centre for Environment and Human Health</a> at the University of Exeter, UK.</p>
<div id="research" class="section level1">
<h1>Research</h1>
<p>My research primarily concerns the benefits that the natural environment has on human physical health and psychological well-being. I primarily use quantitative methods and the analysis of large surveys in my work, though I have experience of experimental and intervention research as well. Some of the projects I work on, or have worked on, include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="bluehealth2020.eu">BlueHealth</a> - looking at the human health benefits of Europe’s coasts and waterways</li>
<li><a href="https://ukprp.org/what-we-fund/groundswell/">GroundsWell</a> - looking at community-led systems transformation of green and blue spaces for the benefit of population health</li>
<li><a href="https://www.smartline.org.uk/">Smartline</a> - looking at how everyday technology can benefit the health and happiness of people in social housing in Cornwall, UK</li>
<li><a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/healthsciences/closing-the-gap/funded-projects/">What does blue do for you?</a> - looking at the potential that aquatic natural environments have in shaping the well-being of people with bipolar and psychosis</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="teaching" class="section level1">
<h1>Teaching</h1>
<p>As for teaching, I lead a module on <a href="https://medicine.exeter.ac.uk/people/module/?mod_code=HPDM029">Nature, Health, and Well-being</a> for the <a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/medicine/environment-health-msc/">MSc Environment and Human Health</a> where I also lecture on quantitative methods and statistics. I co-convene a <a href="https://medicine.exeter.ac.uk/cpd/naturehealth/">CPD course</a> on the same topic. I also lecture or lead research groups for the <a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/medicine/medicine/">BMBS</a> programme, <a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/medicalsci/medicalsci/">BSc Medical Sciences</a>, and for a module on <a href="https://medicine.exeter.ac.uk/programmes/programme/modules/module/?moduleCode=CSC2010M&amp;ay=2018/9">Oceans and Human Health</a>. I have recently provided guest lectures for the Universities of Bath (nature and physical activity) and Edinburgh (questionnaire design for people-environment studies).</p>
