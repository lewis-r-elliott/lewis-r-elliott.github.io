        <p>I am currently a Lecturer in Environment and Public Health at the <a href="ecehh.org">European Centre for Environment and Human Health</a> at the University of Exeter, UK.</p>
<h1 id="research">Research<a href="#research" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>My research primarily concerns the benefits that the natural environment has on human physical health and psychological well-being. I primarily use quantitative methods and the analysis of large surveys in my work, though I have experience of experimental and intervention research as well. I am currently co-I on a number of research projects including <a href="https://ukprp.org/what-we-fund/groundswell/">GroundsWell</a>, <a href="https://www.smartline.org.uk/">Smartline</a>, and <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/healthsciences/closing-the-gap/funded-projects/">What does blue do for you?</a>. I previously worked extensively as a post-doc on the EU Horizon 2020 funded <a href="bluehealth2020.eu">BlueHealth</a> project.</p>
<h1 id="teaching">Teaching<a href="#teaching" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>As for teaching, I lead a module on <a href="https://medicine.exeter.ac.uk/people/module/?mod_code=HPDM029">Nature, Health, and Well-being</a> for the <a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/medicine/environment-health-msc/">MSc Environment and Human Health</a> where I also lecture on quantitative methods and statistics. I co-convene a <a href="https://medicine.exeter.ac.uk/cpd/naturehealth/">CPD course</a> on the same topic. I also lecture or lead research groups for the <a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/medicine/medicine/">BMBS</a> programme, <a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/medicalsci/medicalsci/">BSc Medical Sciences</a>, and for a module on <a href="https://medicine.exeter.ac.uk/programmes/programme/modules/module/?moduleCode=CSC2010M&amp;ay=2018/9">Oceans and Human Health</a>.</p>
