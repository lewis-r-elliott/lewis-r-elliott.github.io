      <description>Hi. I built this website to consolidate and better organise my academic work than I thought was possible with other pre-existing platforms. I also aim to (gradually) make my work more ‘open’ by including published papers as well as their draft versions, revisions, and peer reviews/responses, along with (where possible) related data and code.
It essentially consists of a lot of static content and external links. Not the prettiest, but hopefully contains lots of useful information.</description>
